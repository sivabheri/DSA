# Floyd - Warshall Algorithm : Dynamic Programming algorithm. 

''' 
It works for both directed and undirected graphs.
used to find the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in a weighted graph.

Note: It can handle graphs with negative weights but does not work with negative weight cycles.

Steps:
1 . Convert Adjacency List to Distance Matrix:

	Create a distance matrix dist where dist[i][j] is initialized to:
	The weight of the edge from i to j (if it exists) else 0 if i=j and âˆž if there's no direct edge between i and j.

2 . Apply the Floyd-Warshall Algorithm:

	Use dynamic programming to update the shortest distances for all pairs of nodes.

3 . Detect Negative Cycles:

	Check the diagonal of the distance matrix. If any dist[i][i]<0, the graph contains a negative weight cycle.
